# Release Notes

<div class="documentation__toc"></div>

## Versioning Scheme

PyroCMS, it's first-party addons, and the Streams Platform all maintain a [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/) convention: `MAJOR.MINOR.MATCH`

Patches may be released as often as every week. Patches will never contain breaking changes.

Minor releases will be released as communicated (usually every 4-6 months) and will also never contain breaking changes to standard installations but may require database migrations. Minor version changes _may_ also contain small changes necessary to custom extensions or overridden configuration for example; however these changes will always be communicated through release notes.  

When referencing the Streams Platform or addon packages from your `composer.json`, you should always use a version constraint such as `~1.6.*`, since patches are safe and minor versions may include migrations.

Major releases are separated by years and represent fundamental shifts in the framework's architecture and/or conventions. Currently, there are no major version changes in development.

## Support Policy

For LTS releases, such as PyroCMS v3.6, bug fixes are provided for 2 years and security fixes are provided for 3 years. These releases provide the longest window of support and maintenance. For general releases, bug fixes are provided for 6 months and security fixes are provided for 1 year. For all first-party addons, only the latest two releases receive bug fixes.

## PyroCMS 3.7

We've made numerous changes to increase performance, updated to Laravel 5.7, added a new UI feature, and included a brand new System management and monitoring module among other things.
